In general terms, it's a Linux system designed specifically for the development of the Open Science concept, based on the reproducibility and replicability of the research. </br></br> It's an implementation built under the MIT license using the Docker platform, an open-source project that automates the implementation of applications within software containers, providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating system-level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses the Linux kernel resource isolation features, such as cgroups and namespaces, as well as the file system AuFS (advanced multi layered unification filesystem) to allow independent containers to run in a single Linux instance, avoiding an overload of initialization and maintenance of virtual machines.

For the distribution of bioinformatics software, two large open source projects have been integrated Dugong: LinuxBrew and BioConda, totaling over 3,500 bioinformatics packages and their respective dependencies. Dugong is the only system focused on bioinformatics that offers Anaconda Navigator, a graphical package manager for Conda and the BioConda repository, allowing the installation of packages and tools through its graphical interface.
